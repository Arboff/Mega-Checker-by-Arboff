Removed bug where the program would suddenly crash at a certain account. Issue was caused by not adding "UTF-8" coding when reading the files.

Added a counter for Hits / Fails / Customs on the top of the status bar.
Added functionality to look for keyword in the account upon HIT
Added String Position in Hit message
Added TRUE/FALSE keyword flag on hits

Visual Improvements.
